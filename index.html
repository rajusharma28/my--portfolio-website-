        <p>"I built a responsive gym website with smooth navigation, showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and the MERN stack for a seamless user experience.".</p>
        <p> 
          I built a portfolio website using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The site showcases my web development skills with a clean design and interactive features. I created a backend to manage user data and used React for a responsive front-end. This project helped me improve my skills in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

        <p>This platform makes it so easy to share feedback, and I love the user-friendly design!.</p>
